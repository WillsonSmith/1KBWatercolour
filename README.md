1KBWatercolour
==============

A small website to show posts by ["Shitty_Watercolour"](http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour) on Reddit. Aiming to be very close to 1KB.


This was inspired by: [A post on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/23kbjz/1kb_challenge/)

The original however, required JQuery so I wanted to make my own, smaller version.


This is slightly over 1KB sitting at 1135Bytes not gzipped. I could cut it down but I
didn't really want to refactor, and I wanted to keep some best practices I have.
